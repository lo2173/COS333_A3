Contribution: I wrote the runserver.py program to run the web application based on response
created using flask in the reg.py program. The reg.py program contains three functions, two
which work based on the approute and one helper function. The purpose of the function search_results
is to access the database to get the information to fill out the html template: regresults, based on
the context of the search query and where it was called from (either as the homepage or from the
"another search" on the regdetails page). The function regdetails works similarly by filling out the
regresults.html template using flask and setting cookies to be used in the "another search" link. I
created a total of 8 templates which correspond to one primary page, one secondary page, and error pages
as needed.
Sources: I accessed some documentation for html tables and the flask.request.url functionality
as linked below and used ed:

Time: 7 hrs
Assessment: It was a really good way to learn the basics of HTML in my opinion I enjoyed it/
